          <p>My hobbies include painting mostly plants and scenery, as I elso enjoy looking after my collection of house plants. PC gaming, reading non-fiction/fiction/history books, photography and getting out in nature. I love travelling, I aspire to experience as many countries as possible. History has always been something I have been passionate about, however having studied my fist year in 2018 I discovered it is not something that I would like to create a career in. I want to learn a new practical skill base which can offer me a future in employment and would love to be able to study something of the future rather than the past. Whilst studying ICT in high school, my teacher always commended me for my quick and logical understanding of the course and I always looked forward to this class. My marketing internship with my high school involved a lot of computer-based work mainly with Excel, writing articles for the college newspaper as well as assisting with the editing and upkeep with the college website. Editing the website was not my initial role, however after giving my ideas to the team a few times they continued to ask for my help with the design which was work I enjoyed. After studying History at first year degree level feeling unfulfilled, I figured that I am good at writing essays as I can understand complex concepts and bring them down to a more understandable language. I began teaching myself HTML and CSS with W3schools and was surprised with how much I enjoyed it. I love to read, one book that has assisted my eagerness to get into this new and exciting industry is Yuval Noah Harariâ€™s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century in which she discusses the massive potential of artificial intelligence for the human species and being a historian herself tied my interests together perfectly. I have kept a record of my solo projects on my github account which you can see
