		<!-- Introduction-->
		<section class="center">
			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>
				I am a 20 year old first year Multimedia Computung student studying at Liverpool John Moores University. I was born on the Wirral but have lived in the city of Liverpool for two years and plan on staying here for a short while!
				I currently have a part time job alongside my studies as a bartender in Whetherspoons.
				Travelling the world is my ultimate aim, to experience as much of the world as possible, therefore my dream job would be flexible around this such as freelancing my skills as a developer.
				I love nature and all animals, I am vegan for this reason as I am passionate abotout preserving nature and protecting animal rights.
				In my spare time, I like getting away from the computer screen and taking walks in nature, photography, reading and listening to music. I also enjoy PC gaming, so I am curious about broadening my coding skills and possibly venturing out to game programming in the future.
